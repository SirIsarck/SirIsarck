## Hi there

## About Me:

Hey, I’m Isarck Eser (@SirIsarck) — a Web3 Product Strategist, DeFi & DePIN Builder, and Content Creator passionate about designing decentralized systems that solve real-world problems.

I focus on building scalable, human-centered blockchain products by combining financial innovation (DeFi) and physical infrastructure (DePIN) to empower communities.
While I’m not a coder, I specialize in concept design, product structure, storytelling, and strategy, bridging the gap between technology and people

## About SunChain: 

SunChain is a Decentralized Energy + Finance Network built on Ethereum, connecting community-owned solar hubs through blockchain and DeFi mechanisms.

By merging DePIN infrastructure with DeFi token models, SunChain enables transparent energy generation, real-time payments, and sustainable economic incentives for users and operators.


## How It Works:

1. Communities install solar panels equipped with smart IoT meters.


2. Energy data is stored on-chain via Ethereum oracles.


3. Users pay using stablecoins or stake SunChain tokens.


4. Smart contracts automate payments and revenue sharing between maintainers and investors.


 ## Why It Matters?

Expands DeFi access to real-world energy systems.

Creates new income streams for rural operators.

Builds trust with on-chain energy data and transparent transactions.

Demonstrates how blockchain can fund and power infrastructure sustainably.
